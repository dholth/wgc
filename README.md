wheel (greater compression)

Prototype for a future more space-efficient revision of wheel.

Can be installed with https://github.com/pypa/pip/compare/master...dholth:zstd-wheel

(Standard pip will install the nested archive as-is instead of unpacking. These repacked wheels should not be uploaded to the index)
